## Round 43 (latest)

**Type**: 产品功能升级

**Flagship**: Conversation picker modal for message forwarding

### Completed
- Created `ConversationPickerModal` component with searchable conversation list, keyboard-friendly selection, and loading states
- Upgraded `useMessageForwarding` hook from localStorage-only logging to real API-based forwarding via `streamChat`
- Replaced native `prompt()` dialog with polished modal UI for selecting target conversations
- Added forwarding history panel with conversation name and content preview
- Added CSS for picker modal (search, list items, icons, hover states, animations)
- Fixed duplicate import lint error and useEffect setState lint warning

### Verified
- ✅ 27 unit tests pass
- ✅ TypeScript clean, zero-warning ESLint, production build pass
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI passed (run `27812236529`)

### Risks
- Forwarding triggers an AI response in the target conversation (by design, as the message is sent via `streamChat`)
- No undo for forwarding — the forwarding log is append-only in localStorage

### Next Direction
1. Add undo capability for message forwarding
2. Add message forwarding to thread replies (currently only works on main messages)
3. Create a "Forwarded from" indicator in the target conversation

**Recommended next flagship**: Add thread reply forwarding and a forwarded-message indicator.

## Round 42

**Type**: UI/UX 体验升级

**Flagship**: Authenticated workspace shell and chat experience polish

### Completed
- Reworked the core app shell palette, spacing, radii, shadows, and panel hierarchy for a calmer product feel
- Upgraded the chat workspace title/action row, message cards, right-side conversation panel, composer, and loading/empty visual states
- Improved mobile layout rhythm, bottom navigation sizing, message width, composer spacing, and touch-target consistency
- Added semantic workspace navigation with `aria-current` state and a focused `TopBar` regression test
- Normalized primary/ghost button states so disabled, hover, focus, and wrapped toolbar states remain readable

### Verified
- ✅ 26 unit tests pass, including the new `TopBar` navigation accessibility test
- ✅ Functions typecheck, zero-warning ESLint, and production build pass
- ✅ Rendered QA passed on desktop 1440×920, image workspace interaction, and mobile 390×844 with stubbed authenticated data
- ✅ Console health checked during rendered QA with no warnings or errors
- ✅ GitHub Actions `Deploy Cloudflare Pages` passed (run `27764831940`), including remote D1 migration and deployment

### Risks
- The broader app still has some dense localStorage-backed message-action surfaces that deserve a future workflow pass
- Visual identity remains mascot-led; stronger brand assets would allow a larger leap in perceived maturity

### Next Direction
1. Replace prompt-based message forwarding with a real conversation picker flow
2. Continue reducing localStorage-only message action state for cross-device consistency
3. Audit image/video upload flows for richer progress, error recovery, and success confirmation states

**Recommended next flagship**: Upgrade the message forwarding and saved-action workflow from local-only utilities into a polished cross-conversation interaction.

## Round 41

**Previous direction**: Message threading improvements

**Flagship**: Durable D1-backed Thread Center

### Completed
- Replaced browser-local anonymous thread strings with authenticated D1 records tied to conversations and parent messages
- Added add/edit/delete/clear APIs, input validation, stable IDs/timestamps, indexes, and chat-deletion cleanup
- Added a desktop and mobile Thread Center with reply counts, latest activity, parent previews, and jump-to-message behavior
- Extracted focused `MessageThread` and `ThreadCenter` components from the chat workspace
- Added stale-response protection, mutation loading/error states, and search support for structured replies

### Verified
- ✅ 25 unit tests pass, including validation, grouping, and stale request coverage
- ✅ Functions typecheck, zero-warning ESLint, and production build pass
- ✅ Local Pages + D1 QA passed at 1440×900 and 390×844
- ✅ Create, reload persistence, Thread Center jump, edit, delete, empty state, and console health verified
- ✅ GitHub Actions `Deploy Cloudflare Pages` passed (run `27761178761`), including remote D1 migration and deployment

### Risks
- Older localStorage thread notes are not migrated because they had no conversation-safe ownership metadata
- Other message actions (pin/bookmark/edit/forward) still use browser-local state

### Next Direction
1. Replace the prompt-based forwarding placeholder with a real conversation picker and actual target-conversation insertion
2. Persist pin/bookmark/edit metadata server-side for cross-device consistency
3. Add per-thread unread/activity indicators if thread volume grows

**Recommended next flagship**: Complete a real message-forwarding workflow and migrate the remaining high-value message actions off localStorage.
